# Relevant informations
<br>The project gives the possibility to load the checkpoints on a Mega cloud and to download them to either resume training from a checkpoint or to test the model. If requested we can give the credentials to access our cloud and our experiments.

<br> Training a solar model may require to lower the --train_batch_size parameter for memory reasons

<br> If you can't load a model from cloud, retry by naming the parent folder as "runs"
